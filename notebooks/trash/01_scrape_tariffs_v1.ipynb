The petition alleges that Aludyne violated workers' right to union representation by attempting to replace union leaders, restricting participation in worker committees, penalizing union negotiators, and interfering in union activities through threats, reprisals, and intimidation. The ILC reviews RRM petitions that it receives, and the accompanying information, within 30 days.</p>\n",
